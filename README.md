# Rubinator
Rubinator is a powerful Ruby program that creates a website directory and an `index.html` file for you! It'll even include a `js` and `css` if you so choose.

## Generate a Website Template!
Rubinator requires Ruby version `3.2.2`. Once you have that version in place, install all the Ruby Gems.
```bash
  bundle install
```
Then fire up the program using `thor` and follow the prompts!
```bash
  thor rubinator:build
```

## How to Run the Test Suite
So you want to extend our functionality, eh? Make sure you run the test suite and add specs as needed. Mmmk, thanks.
```bash
  rspec spec
```

This project is inspired by [_Exercises for Programmers_](https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding/dp/1680501224), Exercise 43, p.78 (2015 edition). The test suite, application name, and software design were created in collaboration with @house9 and @nataliadiaz2.
